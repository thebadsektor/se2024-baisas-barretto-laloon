## Introduction

The SD-3101 Product Locator is a web-based application designed to help users 
efficiently locate products in retail stores. The application addresses the 
challenge of navigating large stores and quickly finding desired products, 
improving the overall shopping experience.

## Project Overview

Background and Context
In large retail environments, finding specific products can be challenging for customers. GPS-based systems are often impractical for indoor navigation due to signal limitations. The SD-3101 Product Locator addresses this issue by providing a manual input system where store administrators enter product locations into a static database.

Target Audience

• Administrators: Employees who manage the store’s inventory and layout. They input and update the locations of products in the system.
• Customers: Users who visit the store and use the application to search for and locate products.

Real-World Applications and Potential Impact

• Enhanced Shopping Experience: Customers can quickly find the exact aisle 
    and shelf location of products, reducing the time spent searching in-store.
• Efficient Store Management: Store administrators can easily update product 
    locations as inventory changes, ensuring the information remains accurate and up-to-date.
• Improved Store Navigation: By providing clear location data, the application helps 
    customers navigate the store more efficiently, leading to a more satisfying shopping experience.


## Objectives
Develop a Solution for Product Location Management

- Create a web application enabling store administrators to manually input 
and manage product locations, including specifying aisle and shelf details.

Implement User-Friendly Features
